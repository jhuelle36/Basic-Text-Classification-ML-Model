# Basic-Text-Classification-ML-Model
This code trains a binary classification model for movie reviews using TensorFlow. The model's neural network contains six layers: vectorization layer, embedding layer, dropout layer 1, one-dimensional global average pooling layer, dropout layer 2, and a single neuron dense layer for classification.
