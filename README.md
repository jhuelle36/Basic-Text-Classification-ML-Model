# Basic-Text-Classification-ML-Model
This code trains a binary classification model for movie reviews using TensorFlow. Uses 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. Learned to create this model using TensorFlow tutorials.

The model's neural network contains six layers: 
- Vectorization layer
- Embedding layer: 16 neurons
- Dropout layer 1: 16 neurons
- One-dimensional global average pooling layer: 16 neurons
- Dropout layer 2: 16 neurons
- Dense layer: 1 neuron


Overall Accuracy: % 87.33
